# Print numbers from 1 to 10 randomly

## Description

The `print_numbers_random_order.sh` script will print numbers from 1 to 10 randomly.
This is a simple script and will create the same output as `shuf -i 1-10`

I already tested in Linux and MACOS.

## Run the script

Open the terminal/console and download the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jeanpereira/random_numbers.git
```

Running the script:
```
$ bash random_numbers/print_numbers_random_order.sh
```
